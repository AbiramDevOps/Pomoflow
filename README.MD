# Pomoflow - Pomodoro Timer

Pomoflow is a modern, web-based **Pomodoro timer** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It follows the classic Pomodoro technique with **focus sessions**, **short breaks**, and a **long break every 4 cycles**.  

This project includes **experimental Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode** using the [Document Picture-in-Picture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Picture-in-Picture_API) and **Canvas** for a custom PiP display.  

You can also enable **white noise** for a better focus environment with **rain and thunder sounds**.
