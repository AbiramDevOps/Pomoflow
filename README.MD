## ‚ú® Why Pomoflow? What Makes It Unique?

While there are many Pomodoro timers, Pomoflow stands out with:
*   **Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Support:** Uniquely leverages the experimental Document Picture-in-Picture API to create a custom, always-visible timer window. This is perfect for multitaskers who need to keep track of time without switching tabs or windows.
*   **Immersive White Noise:** Built-in rain and thunder sounds to create a focused auditory environment.
*   **Pure Web Tech:** No frameworks, no bloat. Just vanilla JS for a fast and lightweight experience.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
